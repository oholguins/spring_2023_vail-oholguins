## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment

Hyperparameters:
  These are attributes that are applied to control the learning process of an model. Hyperparameters that can be edited are: Number of layers, Dimensions of the layers, Learning Rate, Training Epochs

Forward Pass:
  Going through the network one must apply calculations on each layer to get the output from the final layer from the input at the first.
    multiplying the inputs from the previous layer by the input layer's weights and the next layer then finalizing by applying the activation function to the product
  
 Backpropagation:
  Utilized after forward pass to adjust the neural network's weights based on how accurate or inaccurate the forward pass's predictions were.
  
 Accuracy:
  As the networks parameters get updated one must calculate the model's acuuracy on a validation set after training with those settings.
