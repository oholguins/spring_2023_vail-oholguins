## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment

CNNs:
  Convolutional Neural Networks uses 'convolutions' to apply filters over images. This allows it to process the important features of an image instead of relying on a corner of it.

Overfitting and Regularization:
  Overfitting has an visual indicator and it is when the error values for the training and testing sets are extremely different.

Dropout:
 Dropout is utilized to prevent overfitting and helps the network from depending on the output of layers and works it harder to look for hints.

Pooling Layer with Padding:
  Pools a specified grid of numbers and selects the one with the highest value. This process is repeated until completed and results in reduced spacial dimensions.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment

Question 3 was extremely difficult for me for some reason, I have a local environment set up so that I can utilize my GPUs Tensor cores to process the code faster but it potentially causes problems? I spent like an hour troubleshooting before I gave up and used what Google has to offer.
  All of my approaches were not too far off from my final answer but I had to go through my files to see recordings from standup meetings and the programs VOD to see if someone got walked through the assignment and finally found the help I needed.
