# Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Topics covered in today's module
* Linear models in machine learning
* Introduction to TensorFlow
* Dataloaders
* Building a simple Neural Network

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
   *Learned linear models such as Score, coef_ and intercept_
    *coef = coefficient
   *Learned to train then evaluate models after building a neural network, predict using the model trained and verifying predictions made with the created model
    *"tf.keras.layers.Dense" outputs values called 'logits'
   
## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
   *learning about coef_ and intercept_ was neat because it reminded me of plotting points using the same concepts in highschool geometry math classes. Doing it again brought back distant memories to reminisce in.
