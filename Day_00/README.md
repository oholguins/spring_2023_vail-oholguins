# Getting Started

## Topics covered in today's module
* What is a GPU? 
* Python base library basics
* Numpy basics
* Pandas basics

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
AI/ML is much more accessible than I originally thought it to be. With basic knowledge of Python, one can learn Numpy and Pandas with relative ease.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
The last attempt prior to the completion I believe. I got stuck looking things up for an hour or two straight, that killed the little time I had to finish Day 0. Would
  have possibly moved on to halfway through day 1 by now :'( . Next time I will just ask Kunjal for help on a question and move on to the next, hoping that it is not a     follow up of the previous concept.

## Additional resources used 
Utilized w3schools the most as they explain things in a way that 5 year olds can understand.
