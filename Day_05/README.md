* Mean Squared Error
* Mean Absolute Error
* Mean Squared Logarithm Error

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
1. Mean Squared Error
  * Is calculated as the sum of the squared discrepancies between predictions and actual observations.
2. Mean Absolute Error
  * is calculated as the average of the total absolute discrepancies between predicted and observed data.
3. Mean Squared Logarithm Error
  * MSLE is identical to MSE, except the formula for the actual and estimated outputs includes log.
